# Java Final Project

The assignment will test our knowledge and application of database creating and usage using Java, exception handling and Graphical User Interface (GUI), within the Java programming environment.
We are expected to answer all questions by creating a separate program; we will then zip/compress and upload our files.

## Menu

We will first create a simple GUI menu that allows integration and selection of parts or segments of the program such as the creation of a database with a table, option for the user to enter data from the form, display the information stored in the database.
